            The quarter has flown by, and now it's final project time!
            <br>
            My inspiration for this final project comes from all these polaroid photos I have that are just in my drawer.
            <br>
            I want to create something where I can both display and store my polaroids.
            </p>
            <p>
            Below you'll find my final project proposal.
            </p>

              <center><b><h3>Concept</h3></b></center>
              My idea for this final project is to create a polaroid photo stand and storage box.
              I want to create a photo stand that can display multiple polaroid photos and a corresponding storage box where I can store the rest of the polaroids.
              I have a bunch of polaroid pictures that are just sitting in my drawer, and that's what inspired this idea.
              By having my polaroid photos on display, I can reflect on the memories they hold!
              Parts I would need to create are the stand itself, the box, and mini clothespins (to hold the polaroid photos).
              <p></p>
              This idea is inspired by jewelry stands. However, instead of holding jewelry, my stand would hold polaroid photos!

              <b>Intended Use Case</b>
              <br>
              The intended use case for this idea is as a display/home decor item.
              This is something I can put on my desk or nightstand or some kind of flat surface, so that I can see these pictures and easily access the other polaroids not on display.
              The polaroids would have its own place, and I'll have a section of my drawer back.
              <p></p>

              <b>Context</b>
              <br>
              This is something I would keep in my room, but if I were to create multiples, they could be displayed anywhere in the home.
              It's basically a home decor item type thing.
              This idea can be recreated by anyone who wants a unique photo stand and keepsakes box to show their favorite memories or to be reminded of those memories.

              <center><b><h3>Breakdown of Tasks</h3></b></center>
              <b>1. CAD modeling</b>
              <br>
              To start the whole design process of this idea, I plan to use OnShape for CAD modeling.
              I will design the box, polaroid photo stand, and clothespins on here.
              I chose OnShape because of it's ease of use and assembly feature.
              I will be able to visualise what the pieces look like together as well as making sure the mechanical design of the clothespins works.
              If I run into any issues with making things on OnShape, I'll use Rhino.
              <p></p>
              <b>2. Laser cutting</b>
              <br>
              One of the machines I'm going to use is the laser cutter.
              I want to make a majority of the box out plywood and will use the laser cutter to do vector cuts.
              The base box design will contain finger joints, so the box can easily assemble together without outside reinforcements.
              <p></p>
              <b>3. 3D printing</b>
              <br>
              Another machine I'll use is the 3D printer.
              I plan to 3D print the lid of the box, the polaroid stand, and clothespins.
              There are 2 reasons as to why I want to 3D print the box lid.
              One is by making a lid that has a lip that fits with the plywood box to make it easy to take off and put back on when I want access to the stored polaroids.
              Second is that I can create a semi-closed slot on the top of the lid where the photo stand will sit in and be able to prop up without additional reinforcements.
              3D printing will allow me to easily get details of the lip of the lid that is not doable with the laser cutter.
              I also plan to 3D print the main center pole and the corresponding racks. The polaroids will hang from the racks.
              I plan to print each part separately because of build volume constraints as well as in case of errors.
              Just in case something goes wrong in the 3D printing, I wouldn't have to reprint the entire thing.
              The center pole will have slots that the racks will go through.
              <p></p>
              <b>4. Mechanism design</b>
              <br>
              The 4th thing I'm incorporating into this final project is mechanism design.
              I want to make a lid that can pop off the box, so I can easily access the stored polaroids or add polaroids into the storage box.
              This can be considered mechanism design as it combines multiple parts, and the purpose of the lid is to easily remove it.
              The 3D printed clothespins also fall into mechanism design.
              The clothespins will have 2 parts and either I will buy springs to attach the two parts or 3D print the springs themselves.
              These clothespins will hold the polaroid. I plan to make a hole in the clothespins so that I can loop a string through them and hang them from the rack.
