            Hi there! My name is Hannah Nursalim! I'm an MS HCDE student here at UW, and I'm excited to be learning about digital fabrication.
            <br>
            I'm in this class because I'm curious about what digital fabrication is and about the different tools we can use to make things.
          </br>
            <br>
            What I'm most excited for is learning about 3D printing and how to use a 3D printer.
            In terms of peer teaching, I'm excited to show others how to do laser cutting. I learned about it last quarter in Physical Computing and Prototyping and found it to be so much fun!
            I'm curious about the other topics in this course and hope that by the end of this quarter I'll know a little bit about each.
          </br>
            </p>
