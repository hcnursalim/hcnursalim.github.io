              <center><b><h3>Design</h3></b></center>
              For this assignment, we had to create a press fit construction kit.
              After a quick Google search for more inspiration and to confirm my understanding, I thought up of some designs I wanted to create for my kit.
              I decided to do a press fit kit with mini pieces of three different shapes that you can put together to create whatever abstract piece you want.
              I chose 3 shapes: squares, polygons, and stars. I chose these shapes cause I thought it'd be fun to create and piece together.
              <br>
              All you have to do is put them together any way you want to create your own little abstract piece. Just have fun with it!
              <center><b><h3>Process</h3></b></center>
              <u><b>Step 1</b></u>:
              After thinking about various shapes I want to use in my kit, I used Illustrator to create my shapes as well as the file source for the laser cutter.
              I used the rectangle tool, polygon tool, and star tool to create my shapes.
              For the slits, I used the rectangle tool to create them, placed them where I wanted them on each shape,then used pathfinder to compound and subtract the shapes.
              I changed the outline of the shape to 0.001 pt so that the laser cutter recognized it for a vector cut.
              <br>
              <u><b>Step 2</b></u>:
              Once my file was ready with the shapes I wanted, I went to the laser cutter to do a test run. Using one of the MacBooks from the MILL, I opened my file on Illustrator and started the cutting process.
              I turned on the exhaust, air compressor, and the laser cutter itself. I adjusted the focus so that the focusing "key" was just touching the material.
              After that, I went to Print and adjusted the Setup and Preferences. I made sure to choose the right laser cutter, then in the Preferences I adjusted Place Size and the Vector settings. I used 25% speed, 100% power and 100% frequency.
              I did have issues with my Illustrator file in that the laser cutter didn't recognize my vectors. I had to create a new Illustrator file using the MILL's MacBook and recreated the test shape, and that file was recognized by the laser cutter.
              <br>
              <u><b>Step 3: Iterate!</b></u>
              After my test laser cut, I realized the slits on my shape didn't fit well together. That's when I realized the purpose of the calipers. I measured the thickness of my cardboard and used that number to determine the size of the slit.
              I went back to my Illustrator file and adjusted my shapes. I used 0.09in for my slit width to have the shapes fit together, so that when shaken it wouldn't come apart.
              <br>
              <u><b>Step 4</b></u>:
              Once I adjusted my shapes, I did another test cut with the laser cutter. I did the same process as step 2. This time my shapes fit together! So I went ahead and cut out the remaining shapes I had on my document, and my kit was completed.
              <p>
              I did figure out what my initial Illustrator file problem was. When I created my shapes and used pathfinder, the stroke was automatically aligned inside instead of center. When I fixed the stroke alignment, the stroke weight of 0.001pt looked how it was supposed to versus how it looked at 0.000pt when aligned to inside.
            </p>

              <br>He taught me how to use pathfinder to create the shapes I wanted to cut.</br>
